/*
Code Challenge. Minimal difference between groups

Given an array of n consecutive numbers. For example:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Write a function that:
    - Divide the original sequence into two groups of consecutive numbers.
    - Return the combination that has the smallest difference between both payments and its result.

Example:
    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Output => 1

Demostration:
    Combination: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5, 6] => Difference: 10 - 11 = 1
    Combination: [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6] => Difference: 6 - 15 = 9
